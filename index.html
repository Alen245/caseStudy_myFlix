        <h3>Back-end Development</h3>
        <p>I employed Node.js and Express.js for server-side operations. For data storage, MongoDB was my go-to because of its versatility. Standard practices were followed with data being exchanged in JSON format.</p>
        <p>Using Postman, I ensured the back-end's functionality and also implemented secure user sign-in processes.</p>

        <h3>Front-end Development</h3>
        <p>For the user interface, React was my tool of choice, guaranteeing a responsive layout across devices. The site showcases movie lists, detailed movie descriptions, user sign-in, and profile settings.</p>
